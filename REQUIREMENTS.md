# Async Output Service - Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

The Async Output Service enables applications to return output to clients asynchronously in real-time and/or persist the output for later retrieval. It is designed as a highly scalable, performant, and distributed system to support millions of requests concurrently.

## 2. Core Use Cases

### 2.1 Real-time Asynchronous Output Delivery
- **Primary Use Case**: Applications submit long-running jobs and need to return results to clients asynchronously
- **Real-time Streaming**: Support streaming output as it becomes available during job execution
- **Webhook Integration**: Deliver output via HTTP webhooks to client endpoints
- **Client Polling**: Allow clients to poll for job status and output

### 2.2 Output Persistence
- **Durable Storage**: Persist job outputs in configurable databases for later retrieval
- **Output History**: Maintain historical output data for audit and debugging purposes
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention periods for different types of output
- **Output Versioning**: Support multiple output versions per job

### 2.3 High-Scale Processing
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support millions of concurrent job submissions
- **Distributed Processing**: Distribute job processing across multiple service instances
- **Load Balancing**: Efficiently distribute load across service nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operation despite individual node failures
