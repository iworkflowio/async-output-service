# Go API Server for genapi

An API for real-time matching of asynchronous output generation with client consumption.

The service acts as a matching intermediary between applications generating outputs 
asynchronously and clients waiting to receive specific outputs in real-time.

**Core Concept**: Stream-based matching using streamID to connect senders with receivers.

**Phase 1**: Real-time in-memory matching with long polling
**Phase 2**: Persistent storage with replay capability

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t genapi .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it genapi
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
